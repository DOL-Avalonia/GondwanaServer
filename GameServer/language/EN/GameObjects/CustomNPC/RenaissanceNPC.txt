# RENAISSANCE NPC
RenaissanceNPC.AskForRenaissance:			Would you like to be reborn more powerful? So bring me the Philosopher's Stone!
RenaissanceNPC.RenaissanceDone:             So it is... You have chosen the path of rebirth... You can go rediscover the world now, and achieve new tasks no mortal can ever accomplish...
RenaissanceNPC.DeniedRenaissance:           You have already fullfilled the path to your rebirth, I cannot do anything for you anymore.
