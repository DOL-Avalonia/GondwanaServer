NaturalistTrainer.Druid.Explain:		{0} says, "Followers of the Path of Harmony, druids use natural magic. They are primarily healers with a variety of spells they can learn to aid their realm mates. They receive basic buffs and can specialize in buffs that are unique in the realm. Druids have some offensive capabilities. Besides the ability to pick up a weapon and swing it at an enemy, they can cast poison spells to physically harm their opponent and cast root spells to freeze their opponent in place. They are also able to summon Nature's spirits as companions to travel or fight beside them. The role of a healing druid can be exacting. It takes a lot of patience, dedication and quick reflexes to keep your group healthy and performing their best. A druid can choose to spend his life alone with his spirit companion, dedicated to a group, or a little of both."

Wardens can train in one hand weapons as well as parry and are able to wear Scale armor and use a standard medium shield. They also have the ability to use a short bow.

StalkerTrainer.Nightshade.Explain:		{0} says, "While not physically as imposing as other assassins of the realms, those which choose to walk down the Way of Stealth and follow the Path of Essence will depend on their quick reactions, stealth, speed, and sharp wit to combat the enemies of the Hibernian Realm. To assist in the endeavor, the Nightshade Elders have developed and passed down a few magical baubles that grow in strength as the Nightshade becomes more acquainted with his repertoire of skills. In addition to the more common ways that the Nightshades uses to dispatch their foes, they freely practice the skill and art to poisoned weaponry and then turn these deadly blades upon their enemies.

Warlock Primary spells take about twice as long to cast as regular spells in the game - however, anytime the Warlock casts a primary spell, they can (at no cost) add in a secondary spell that will land at the same time as the primary. This allows Warlocks to mix and match pairs of spells to fit whatever situation they find themselves in."

The character of a Thane draws upon both the Magic of Lightning and the Strength of Melee combat to defend Midgard. Thanes belong to the Viking Profession, but are part of the Hybrid grouping of characters; they attack their enemies through the use of Lightning when their foe is at range, and their Strength and Melee Weapons once they reach their target.

This brawling class channels earthen elemental powers to perform its primal magic. These powers augment Mauler combat abilities and combat styles. The class does not have a normal power pool, however. It will gain power from taking damage in combat. Maulers can specialize in two forms of melee combat. Mauler Staff uses a weighted, primitive form of the quarterstaff. It is known for its raw power, rather than the finesse of other staff based skills. Fist wraps are rune inscribed pieces of cloth, or heavy weights attached to the fists to augment the Mauler's naturally powerful hand to hand combat. Their spell lines augment melee combat depending on the specialization. Aura manipulation augments the natural auras around the Mauler, enhancing their defense and health, as well as those around them. Magnetism uses the power of the earth to disrupt the actions of enemies in close quarters with the Mauler. Power strikes allows the Mauler to launch a barrage of attacks that will damage and debuff anyone who decides to face them in combat."
